### Definition
Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that allows sequential traversal through a complex data structure without exposing its internal details.

Thanks to the Iterator, clients can go over elements of different collections in a similar fashion using a single iterator interface.

### Conceptual Example
The main idea behind the Iterator pattern is to extract the iteration logic of a collection into a different object called iterator. This iterator provides a generic method of iterating over a collection independent of its type.

### How to run
- from root run: `go run behavioral_patterns/iterator/*.go`
